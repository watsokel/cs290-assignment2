    <h2>About the Webpage Author</h2>
    
    <p><img src="kw125x100.png">My name is Kelvin Watson and I live in Portland, Oregon. I was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I completed my previous degree at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada in 2007. Prior to obtaining my B.Sc(Pharm.), I completed third year in the Microbiology and Immunology program, also at UBC. As such, my educational background has mostly been in the life and health sciences. Immediately after graduation, I successfully earned my license to practice as a pharmacist, and started working on the acute care dispensary at St. Paulâ€™s Hospital. During this time, I worked as both a front-line pharmacist, as well as an interim dispensary supervisor and gained valuable skills in operations, leadership and human resources.</p>
    <p>I decided to pursue the professional post-baccalaureate Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at Oregon State University for a number of reasons. After almost seven years as a pharmacist, I decided it was time for a change. I left my position, and moved to the United States with my spouse in 2013. After some time off, I began to realize that I had largely ignored a passion of mine, computer science. Even during my years as a pharmacist, I often found myself more interested in the technical aspects of my profession, including automated dispensing, robotics, and various aspects of healthcare software. Another significant reason why I have chosen this field of study is my husband. He is a software engineer who absolutely loves his job, and he is a wonderful source of inspiration and encouragement. Seeing him grow both professionally and personally has inspired me to pursue my passion for computer science.</p>
